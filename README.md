# Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project is focused on performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to classify text data into positive and negative sentiments based on the content of the text. The project achieves an accuracy of 83% on a sentiment analysis dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and is specifically designed for sentiment analysis. It contains a collection of text data with associated sentiment labels. The dataset is divided into two sentiment classes: positive and negative.

## Project Contents

The project is organized into the following sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** This section involves data loading, cleaning, and exploration. It includes tasks such as removing unnecessary columns, handling missing data, and text preprocessing, which may involve tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming or lemmatization.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Text data needs to be transformed into numerical features for machine learning. This is typically achieved using techniques like Count Vectorization or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization.

3. **Model Training:** In this section, a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) is trained on the transformed text data. The dataset is usually split into training and testing sets to assess model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A classification report is generated to provide insights into the model's performance.

5. **Prediction:** The project includes a function that takes an input text and predicts its sentiment using the trained model. The sentiment prediction is classified as positive or negative.

6. **Conclusion:** The project concludes by summarizing the key findings and insights from the sentiment analysis, discusses potential improvements or future work, and offers a final perspective on the project's success.

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy of 83% on the sentiment analysis dataset from Kaggle. The model is capable of predicting the sentiment of text data as either positive or negative with a reasonable level of accuracy.
